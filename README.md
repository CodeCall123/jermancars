# Jermancars


Jerman Cars is a car dealership based in Cyprus, specializing in selling a wide variety of vehicles across the island. The current website is outdated and lacks modern features, making it difficult for customers to browse through car listings efficiently. Jerman Cars is capable of importing any car model upon request, offering a personalized service for clients seeking specific vehicles.

For the new website, they need an intuitive platform where they can easily create and manage listings for their available cars. The primary goal is to showcase their inventory, with customers being able to view details and call or visit the dealership to make purchases, so online payments are not required. The website should feature their brand colors—brown, black, and white—and have a clean, user-friendly design that reflects their professionalism and expertise in the car industry.
